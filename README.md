# maxreiter.dev

My personal website! Built with HTML and CSS using [Caddy's](https://caddyserver.com) templating engine. The site works similarly to a static site generator such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) or [Zola](https://www.getzola.org): pages are stored as Markdown in the `content` directory & rendered to HTML using Caddy's [markdown directive](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.templates#docs).

View the live site at [maxreiter.dev](https://maxreiter.dev).
