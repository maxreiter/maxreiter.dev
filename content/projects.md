# \# DCOM

**DCOM** is a tool I wrote for the [Phoenix College](https://phoenixcollege.edu) IT department. It allows us to decommission our devices from backend services such as **SCCM**, **Sophos**, and **Active Directory**. The tool is written in `Go` using various libraries to connect to the backend services, as well as `Bulma CSS` & `jQuery` for the frontend.

At this time, the codebase is not publicly available. However, it is being rewritten and as that progresses, it will become available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maxreiter).

# \# Marksman

**Marksman** is an API client for the [SnipeIT](https://snipeitapp.com) asset management suite. It is written in `Go` and aims to provide full coverage of the REST API provided by the application.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/maxreiter/marksman).

# \# maxreiter.dev

This website! It was written using the templating engine provided by `Caddy`, so all of the content is actually written in `Markdown` that is then rendered as `HTML`. It uses the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) color scheme because I like it.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/maxreiter/maxreiter.dev).
