## \#\# Professionally

Day to day, I work at the [Phoenix College](https://phoenixcollege.edu) as a desktop support specialist in the IT department. My primary responsibility is to support staff & faculty with any problems they may encounter, as well as fulfill tickets placed by them.

I also maintain **DCOM**, some tooling we use internally in the department. With it, we're able to decommission devices out of our primary backend services with a single request instead of many. For more information, check out the <a href="/projects">projects</a> here on my site.

## \#\# Personally

In my spare time you'll often find me **writing code**, **playing video games**, **listening to music**, or **spending time with my lovely partner**.

Some of my favorite games are **Night in the Woods**, **Prey 2017**, **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**, and the **Mass Effect series**.

As for music, my absolute favorite artist is [Jeff Rosenstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Rosenstock) and his various projects including **Bomb the Music Industry!** and **Antarctigo Vespucci**.

## \#\# Tools, etc

My configs for the various tools mentioned below can be found in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/maxreiter/dotfiles).
